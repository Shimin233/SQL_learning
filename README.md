# SQL_learning

I am going to learn about SQL through online courses and resources. 
Now I am just following this 3-hour YouTube video tutorial [MySQL Tutorial for Beginners \[Full Course\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA)

## SQL conventions
- semi-colon `;` at the end
- # to comment, or in some environments use `--`
- Capitalisation does not matter, though conventionally we capitalise all codes
- To view data table:
    - SELECT * FROM table_name
    - SELECT col1, col2, ... FROM table_name
    - The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set (manually stored into a permanent table)
- Cmd _ Enter to run a single line
- single quotes around text values
- numeric fields not incl in quotes
- MyDatabase.ORDERS
