## Download MySQL and local instance
Just follow the instruction, step by step.

Click the local instance and enter root user's password set earlier; you will enter MySQL Workbench under the name "Local instance 3306"

## Create the database for this course
I downloaded the course materials to \Desktop\SQL_learning

We are going to use create-databases.sql 

Lightning icon at the top left of the middle window: execute the selected or the entire set of codes. 
Click it to execute the whole create-databases.sql.
Output will occur in the middle bottom window. 
Then refresh Schemas by clicking the little refreshing icon at the right top corner of Schemas, 
you will see four new items there.

Among the four, you can check the 'sql_store':
- Tables: where we store data
- Views: which are virtual tables
- Stored Procedures
- Functions

Span sql_store and then span Tables, 
then you can see 
customers, orders, order_item_notes, etc.

You can see three icons on the right of each table. 
Click the third one: table with a lightning to open this table of 'customers'

You will see its contents in the 'result grid' window above the output window 
and simultaneously you can see the middle window shows: 
```mysql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers;
```
Note that simultaneously a new window (query) occurring besides your original Query 1 above the middle window. For now it is ok to close them after finishing the use; the databases are still available in the Schemas.

Then open the 'orders' table, also by clicking the third icon on its right in the Schemas. 
Now a new query occurs with the middle window showing: 
```mysql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.orders;
```
Here in this table, it uses customer_id instead of customer name, address, etc, as one person may place multiple orders; one might change name, address, etc. 
so customer id can identify one customer uniquely

There is an underlying concept: 
_relational databases_ (connecting multiple tables via relationships)



HW: explore invoicing database

It seems that under some tables, it is also possible to have more files like Columns, Indexed, Triggers, etc. Though I do not know how to use them.


## SELECT statement
Recall last time we executed some tables, and the middle window showed `SELECT ...`. 
We are going to dit deeper into such statements in this and following sections.
```mysql
-- two hyphens lead to a comment in mysql

USE sql_store; -- capitalise the keyword, here is USE; terminate this by ';'
-- now sql_store database is selected

SELECT  * -- select all columns; or can select some of them, SELECT 1, 2
FROM customers -- shift+command+return to get output here, or continue:
WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY first_name #ORDER BY a column in the table
-- all three lines above, FROM, WHERE & ORDER BY, are optional; 
-- order must be preserved like this, otherwise syntax error; 
-- can be put in one line as SELECT or each in a new line for a better clarity
```

## SELECT clause
Begin with the simplest use of SELECT, that is picking certain columns from a specified table. 
```mysql
SELECT first_name, last_name, points -- only these three columns, in the exact order specified here
FROM customers
```
We can alter columns by arithmetics.
```mysql
SELECT first_name, last_name, points, points + 10 -- can alter columns by +, -, *, , /, % modulo
FROM customers
```

```mysql
-- can change to new line for each item for clarity
-- can use parethesis in arithmetics
SELECT 
    first_name,  
    last_name, 
    points, 
    (points + 10) * 100 
FROM customers
```
Can use the keyword, AS
```mysql
-- can assign new names for columns generated by arithmetics
SELECT 
    first_name,  
    last_name, 
    points, 
    (points + 10) * 100  AS discount_factor -- if you have a space in the name, use 'discount factor' or "discount factor"
FROM customers
```
In the following paragraphs, we are going to pick columns from a table with or withuot duplication; and we can alter individual entries in a table.
```mysql
SELECT state
FROM customers
-- the output shows all the duplications of entries
```
again we select the customers table from sql_store databse, 
by clicking the 'lightning over a database' icon or typing in the middle window:
```mysql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers
```
then in the result grid, double click the entry in the table, to change the contents as you want, 
click somewhere else in the result grid,
you can see at the bottom of each column, two buttons 'Apply', and 'Revert' become activated, 
click Apply can you will see a popping window telling you review your change, with: 
```mysql
UPDATE `sql_store`.`customers` SET `state` = 'CO' WHERE (`customer_id` = '3');
```
click Apply then Close at the bottom of the popping window to apply your change

(After this you can choose to click Revert to revert your change)

This change applies to every of different window (query), 
can be verified by coding in the middle window like below:

in another query, you can try this to see the change
```mysql
SELECT state
FROM customers
-- the output shows all the duplications of entries
```
Can remove duplications when picking columns from a table, by
```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM customers
-- the output does not show any duplication of entries
```

### Exercise
```mysql
-- Return all the products
--     name
--     unit price
--     new price(unit price * 1.1)

SELECT name, unit_price, unit_price*1.1 AS new_price
FROM products
```
